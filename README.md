# CoffeeRoulette

**TODO: Add description**

## Ideas

* structs for participant, group, round/month
* participant would have email, guild, time_of_day_pref,  (could be built directly from raw sheet data)
* group could be a MapSet of participants
* round would be MapSet of groups
* core function would take a list of active participants & all previous rounds as input and would output a new list of groups
